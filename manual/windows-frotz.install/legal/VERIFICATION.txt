Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The EXE installer has been downloaded from Windows-Frotz'
official GitHub repository <https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Frotz>
and can be verified like this:

1. Download 'WindowsFrotzInstaller.exe' from this page: <https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Frotz/releases/tag/1.26>
2. Obtain the checksum of the exe file.
  Here are two means of obtaining the checksums:
  - Use the PowerShell command 'Get-Filehash'
  - Use the Chocolatey utility 'checksum.exe'
  
  You should get the following result:
  
  WindowsFrotzInstaller.exe:

3. Obtain the checksum of the exe file that came with this package (in the
  'tools' folder). If it has the same hash as the file you downloaded in
  step 1, you have successfully verified the integrity of the exe files.
