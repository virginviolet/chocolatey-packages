    <summary>Replica of Nintendo’s The Legend of Zelda and a game editor</summary>
    <description>Zelda Classic is a tribute to Nintendo’s 1991/1992 video game, The Legend of Zelda. It is an exact replica of the game, but is also comes with a game editor called ZQuest that allows you to make completely new quests, with either the same or enhanced graphics, as well as play the many quests that others have made.
      
    The default installation directory is `%ChocolateyInstall%\lib\zelda-classic`.</description>
