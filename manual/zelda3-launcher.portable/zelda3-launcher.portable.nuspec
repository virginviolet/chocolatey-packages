    <description># Zelda 3 Launcher

A minimalistic Launcher that will download and build Zelda 3, the reimplementation of The Legend of Zelda - A Link to the Past.

## Installation

By default, the launcher will be installed to `C:\Games\Zelda 3 Launcher`. The launcher will build the game into a subfolder called zelda3. A shortcut will to Zelda 3 Launcher be added to the desktop and start menu.

The launcher will ask for a rom. It has to be from the US region with this exact SHA256 hash: `66871D66BE19AD2C34C927D6B14CD8EB6FC3181965B6E517CB361F7316009CFB`.
Additionally, it needs to be located outside of the Zelda 3 Launcher directory.

When you first launch the launcher, it will have a button that says "Download". After it has finished downloading, you can play the game. The "Download" button will change to "Restore". This will make it build the game again. When the [zelda3 repository](https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3) is updated, the button will change to "Update", which will bulid the game again from the current repo.

## Uninstallation

When uninstalling this package, it will remove both the launcher and the game, if the game is in the default zelda3 subdirectory. It will, however, keep any user-made save files and configuration file. If you want to remove the save files and/or confuguration file, you will need to remove them manually. See "Game data" below for their exact location.
If you for some reason want to ununistall the Launcher and keep the game: move the zelda3 folder to any folder outside the "Zelda 3 Launcher" directory, and then uninstall the package.
If you only want to remove the game but keep the launcher: backup your save data and optionally the configuration file (see "Game data" below), then simply delete the zelda3 folder.

## Game data

Default configuration file location: C:\Games\Zelda 3 Launcher\zelda3\zelda3.ini
Default save data location: C:\Games\Zelda 3 Launcher\zelda3\Saves</description>
    <releaseNotes>- Made a change to closing settings window behavior so that it is consistent between the cancel button and the close (X) button.
- Fixed runaway CPU usage while zelda3.exe was running due to it waiting on the game to close and resume control.
