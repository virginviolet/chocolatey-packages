3. Fill out the package contents:

- tools\chocolateyUninstall.ps1 - remove if autouninstaller can
  automatically uninstall and you have nothing additional to do during
  uninstall
- Readme.txt - delete this file once you have read over and used
  anything you've needed from here
- nuspec - fill this out, then clean out all the comments (you may wish
  to leave the headers for the package vs software metadata)
- tools\chocolateyInstall.ps1 - instructions in next section.

4. ChocolateyInstall.ps1:

- For embedded binaries - use `$fileLocation` (`$file`/`$file64`) and
  `Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage`/ `Get-ChocolateyUnzip`.
- Other needs (creating files, setting registry keys), use regular
  PowerShell to do so or see if there is a function already defined:
  https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions
- There may also be functions available in extension packages, see
  https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3A.extension for examples and
  availability.
- Clean out the comments and sections you are not using.

5. Test the package to ensure install/uninstall work appropriately.
 There is a test environment you can use for this -
 https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment
