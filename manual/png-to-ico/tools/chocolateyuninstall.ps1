ï»¿# IMPORTANT: Before releasing this package, copy/paste the next 2 lines into PowerShell to remove all comments from this file:
#   $f='c:\path\to\thisFile.ps1'
#   gc $f | ? {$_ -notmatch "^\s*#"} | % {$_ -replace '(^.*?)\s*?[^``]#.*','$1'} | Out-File $f+".~" -en utf8; mv -fo $f+".~" $f

## NOTE: In 80-90% of the cases (95% with licensed versions due to Package Synchronizer and other enhancements),
## AutoUninstaller should be able to detect and handle registry uninstalls without a chocolateyUninstall.ps1.
## See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/uninstall
## and https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions/uninstall-chocolateypackage

## If this is an MSI, ensure 'softwareName' is appropriate, then clean up comments and you are done.
## If this is an exe, change fileType, silentArgs, and validExitCodes
