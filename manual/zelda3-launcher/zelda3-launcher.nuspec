    <description># Zelda 3 Launcher

A minimalistic Launcher that will download and build Zelda 3, the reimplementation of The Legend of Zelda - A Link to the Past.

## Installation

By default, the launcher will be installed to `C:\Games\Zelda 3 Launcher`. The launcher will build the game into a subfolder called zelda3. A shortcut will to Zelda 3 Launcher be added to the desktop and start menu.

The launcher will ask for a rom. It has to be from the US region with this exact SHA256 hash: `66871D66BE19AD2C34C927D6B14CD8EB6FC3181965B6E517CB361F7316009CFB`.
Additionally, it needs to be located outside of the Zelda 3 Launcher directory.

When you first launch the launcher, it will have a button that says "Download". After it has finished downloading, you can play the game. The "Download" button will change to "Restore". This will make it build the game again. When the [zelda3 repository](https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3) is updated, the button will change to "Update", which will bulid the game again from the current repo.

## Uninstallation

When uninstalling this package, it will remove both the launcher and the game, if the game is in the default zelda3 subdirectory. It will, however, backup save data and configuration.
See "Restore from backup" on how to restore from a backup.
See "Backup removal" if you want to remove the backup.

If you for some reason want to ununistall the Launcher and keep the game: move the zelda3 folder to any folder outside the "Zelda 3 Launcher" directory, and then uninstall the package.

If you only want to remove the game but keep the launcher: backup your save data and optionally the configuration file (see "Game data") by copying them to any location outside the `zelda3` directory, then simply delete the zelda3 folder.

## Restore from backup
To restore files from the backup, follow these steps in order:

1. Download/build the game from the launcher
2. Close the launcher.
3. In Explorer, go to the Launcher's directory (default: `C:\Games\Zelda 3 Launcher`)
4. Move the contents of the `zelda3.bak@[save date]` folder into the `zelda3` folder (there will be a timestamp in place of `[save date]`). Replace all files when prompted.
5. Delete the now empty `zelda3.bak[save date]` folder.

## Backup removal

If you want to remove save data and configuration file backup after uninstallation, you must do so manually. Just delete the Zelda 3 Launcher folder (default location: `C:\Games\Zelda 3 Launcher`).

## Game data

Default backup location: `C:\Games\Zelda 3 Launcher\zelda3.bak[save date]` (but instead of `[save date]`, there will be a timestamp)
Default configuration file location: `C:\Games\Zelda 3 Launcher\zelda3\zelda3.ini`
Default save data location: `C:\Games\Zelda 3 Launcher\zelda3\Saves`</description>
    <releaseNotes>- Made a change to closing settings window behavior so that it is consistent between the cancel button and the close (X) button.
- Fixed runaway CPU usage while zelda3.exe was running due to it waiting on the game to close and resume control.
