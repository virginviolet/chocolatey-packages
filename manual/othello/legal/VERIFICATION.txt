VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The EXE installers can be verified like this:

1. Download 'Othello_Setup.exe' from this page: <https://github.com/Anders-H/Othello>
2. Obtain the checksum of each file.
  Here are two means of obtaining the checksums:
  - Use the PowerShell command 'Get-Filehash'
  - Use the Chocolatey utility 'checksum.exe'
  
  You should get the following result:
  
  Othello_Setup.exe:
  checksum type: sha256
  checksum32: 1D0EA3FDC4160FD79FD39969EA568BDBDCE745FDEFEF13449AEBED07B18105C1
  
3. Obtain the checksum of the exe file that came with this package (in the
  'tools' folder). If it has the same hash as the file you downloaded in
  step 1, you have successfully verified the integrity of the exe files.
4. Open the scripts, 'chocolateyinstall.ps1' and 'chocolateyuninstall.ps1' <CHECK WHICH FILES ARE INCLUDED> in a
text editor or IDE and see if it looks clean.
