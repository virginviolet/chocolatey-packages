The 32-bit and 64-bit EXE installers has been downloaded from the official GitHub repository <INSERT DOWNLOAD PAGE URL HERE>
and can be verified like this:

1. Download 'FILENAME-32-bit.exe' and 'FILENAME-64-bit.exe' from this page:
<INSERT DOWNLOAD URL HERE>
2. Obtain the checksum of each exe file.
  Here are two means of obtaining the checksums:
  
  - Use the PowerShell command 'Get-Filehash'
  - Use the Chocolatey utility 'checksum.exe'
  
  You should get the following results:
  
  FILENAME-32-bit.exe:
  checksum type: sha256
  checksum32: PASTE CHECKSUM HERE (UPPER CASE)
  
  FILENAME-64-bit.exe:
  checksum type: sha256
  checksum64: PASTE CHECKSUM HERE (UPPER CASE)
  
3. Obtain the checksum of the exe files that came with this package (in the
  'tools' folder). If they have the same hash as the files you downloaded in
  step 1, you have successfully verified the integrity of the exe files.
4. Open the scripts, 'chocolateyinstall.ps1' and 'chocolateyuninstall.ps1' <CHECK WHICH FILES ARE INCLUDED> in a
text editor or IDE and see if it looks clean.
