# Chocolatey packages

My packages for [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), the package manager for Windows.

## Installation

The easiest way to get them is to download them from the [Community repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages) once they become available there.

I probably won't push my templates there, but so far, everything else has been intended for the Community repo.

If you want to install them manually, clone the package folder and navigate to it, then run:

`choco pack`

and

`choco install <package name> --source .`
